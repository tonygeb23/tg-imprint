"""Where an AI service key is kept, which is not a document and not settings.json.

TG Imprint's copy of TG Drop Deck's secrets.py. The mechanics are identical and
deliberately unchanged; only the names differ. TG Imprint keeps one kind of
secret: the key for Claude, ChatGPT or Gemini that the describer uses. It is
billable, so it lives in Windows Credential Manager under a name that says
what it is, never in a document file and never in settings.json, which a
user might send to somebody along with the document it belongs to.

Drop Deck's own reasoning follows, about stream keys, and it applies here
word for word.

Where a stream key is kept, which is not the board file.

`stream_password` has always been a `STATION_FIELDS` entry, so it went into
`board.json` along with the eighty pads. That was already the wrong place for
an Icecast source password. **It is a much worse place for a YouTube or
Facebook stream key**, for a reason that is easy to miss: anybody holding that
key can broadcast to the channel it belongs to. A board file is plain JSON, a
user can write one anywhere with Ctrl+F12, and boards get sent to people. There
is nothing about a file full of sound names that suggests a broadcast
credential is in it.

So keys live in **Windows Credential Manager**, under one target name per
station, and the board file keeps only the station's name. `docs/VIDEO-STREAMING-PLAN.md`
says this and the original streaming plan said it before that.

Everything here is `advapi32` through ctypes. No new dependency, and the same
store every other Windows program uses, so a user can see and remove what the
app has kept without taking Drop Deck's word for it.

**Nothing here is allowed to raise.** A machine with a locked down credential
store, or a copy running somewhere that is not Windows, must fall back rather
than stop a show. `store` returns whether it worked, and the caller decides
what to do about it, which for the moment means keeping the key in the board
file the way it always was and saying so.
