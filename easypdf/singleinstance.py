"""One copy of the app at a time, and a second launch reopens the first.

Opening the same program four times leaves four windows fighting over the same
config file and the same tray icon, and for a screen reader user it is worse
than clutter: alt-tab fills with identical entries and there is no way to tell
which one is the real one.

So a second launch does not open a window. It finds the copy already running,
un-hides it, brings it to the front and exits. That is the important half - a
second launch that merely refuses would look, to someone not watching the
screen, exactly like the program failing to start.

How it is made stupid proof
---------------------------

**A named mutex, not a lock file.** Windows releases a mutex when the process
that owns it dies, however it dies - clean exit, crash, or Task Manager. A lock
file has to be cleaned up by the very process that just crashed, so a hard kill
leaves the app permanently convinced it is already running. There is no stale
state here to get stuck in.

**The window is found by a property, not by its title.** The running copy
stamps its top-level window with a private tag via SetProp, and the second
launch looks for that tag. Matching on the title would break the moment the
title changed and would match any other window that happened to share it.

**Local\\ namespace**, so two people signed in to the same machine, or two
remote-desktop sessions, each get their own single instance rather than
blocking each other.

**Every failure falls open.** If anything here raises, the app starts normally.
A bug in this file must never be the reason someone cannot open the program.
