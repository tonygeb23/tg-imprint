"""Update the app itself.

Easy PDF's copy of TG Drop Deck's appupdate.py. Only the marked block near
the top differs. The docstring below is the shared one.

Byte-identical in shape to the Prompt Vault's appupdate.py on purpose: one
update mechanism across every TG Studios app, one set of traps already found,
one thing to fix if it ever breaks. Only the feed URL and the version constant
differ.

Drop Deck 2.0.0 and earlier shipped as a zip with no way to receive a new
version, so every fix after it had to be a manual download. A release with no
update channel is frozen forever - including its bugs. This is that channel.

The trust model is the same shape as sync.py and deliberately stricter, because
this one ends in running an executable:

  1. The manifest is ed25519 signed with the TG Studios *update* key - a
     different key from the prompt feed. A key that can only publish prompts is
     a much smaller thing to lose than one that can run code, and keeping them
     apart means losing the small one stays small.
  2. The installer is SHA-256'd against the signed manifest before it is run.
  3. Nothing is downloaded or run without the user saying yes.

Point 3 is not negotiable. A free tray app that silently replaces its own
executable is indistinguishable from malware, and for a screen reader user an
installer window appearing unannounced, while the app it is replacing vanishes
underneath it, is worse than no update at all.
