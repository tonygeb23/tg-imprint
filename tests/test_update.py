"""Updating the portable copy, which used to install a second copy instead.

HarmonicaPlayer, on Mastodon, 4 September 2026, running the zip:

    "was in portable copy, checked for updates, it sounded like it was
    downloading something but it turns out it gave me the installer version
    and put a new desktop shortcut that linked to installer instead of
    updating the portable version i was hoping it would have"

    "i discovered when it updated it got the installer and put on my c drive
    not updated portable copy"

Both builds are PyInstaller frozen, so `is_frozen()` was true for the zip as
well and it happily downloaded the installer. The installer installed a second
copy elsewhere, made a desktop shortcut to THAT, and left the copy he was
running on the old version. Nothing said so, so from where he was sitting the
update did nothing at all.
